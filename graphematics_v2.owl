This is still work in progress. While version 1.0 was developed in summer 2020, version 2.0 was developed in summer 2025. The present version and is intertwined with Peter Stokes&apos; The Archetype Ontology.

        <rdfs:comment>A combination of two or more graphemes (TX8_Grapheme) that has two or more alphabemes (POGO_Alphabeme) as alphabetic meaning, and in which (as opposed to a POGO_Ligature) graphemes do not have a 1:1 alphabetic meaning. Instead, the alphabetic meaning of the whole abbreviation results from the combination of its component graphemes.

In medieval European writing systems, the graphemes commonly composing an abbreviation are alphabetic graphemes (POGO_Alphabetic_Grapheme; e.g. a Latin &apos;v&apos; surrounded by a Latin &apos;o&apos; as an abbreviation for &apos;vero&apos;); or, more often, one or more alphabetic graphemes combined with one ore more abbreviation marks (POGO_Abbreviation_Mark; e.g. Latin &apos;q;&apos; for &apos;quia&apos;, or modern &apos;dr.&apos; for &apos;doctor&apos;). A POGO_Abbreviation is distinct from a POGO_Brevigraph because the former is a combination of graphemes, while the latter is one grapheme.</rdfs:comment>

Property +{has_a_1_to_1_standard_alphabetic_meaning}, i.e. there is one Alphabeme (not Phoneme) which it represents its standard alphabetic meaning.

Problematic aspect: some Alphabetic Graphemes (that I would call &apos;Combining Alphabetic Graphemes&apos;) can be put above or below another Alphabetic Grapheme, or &apos;Base Alphabetic Grapheme&apos; (e.g. a small &apos;o&apos; over an &apos;u&apos; or, in Greek, a small iota under an omega), thus being used as abbreviations. The same happens today in superscript such as 1st or 2nd in English, or 1° in Italian (for &apos;primo&apos;).

Base Alphabetic Graphemes also have properties:

Combining Alphabetic Graphemes also have properties:

Examples include: p with horizontal trait for Latin &quot;per&quot;, q with horizontal trait for lat. &quot;qui&quot; etc.

Problematic aspect: brevigraphs mostly derive from original graphemes (&apos;p&apos;, &apos;q&apos;, &apos;e&apos; etc.) with modifications. In some cases, such as the &apos;e caudatum&apos; (originating from a ligature between &apos;a&apos; and &apos;e&apos;) or the &apos;4-shaped&apos; abbreviation for final &apos;-rum&apos; in Latin (bonorum etc.), the original graphemes have fused in such a manner that one would hardly distinguish them any more. In other cases, instead, the original traits are easily distinguishable, so one could analyze &apos;p with horizontal trait&apos; as two distinct graphemes, &apos;p&apos; and &apos;horizontal trait&apos;. This relates to the very issue of the definition of grapheme as &apos;minimal&apos; unit.</rdfs:comment>

Examples include: accent, macron meaning long vowel.

Its distinction with textual graphemes, and possibly also with abbreviation marks, may be blurred in practice.

A diacritic dffers from graphemes having +{alphabetic} such as the abbreviation mark because, for instance, we do not consider the &apos;o&apos; in Italian words &apos;pero&apos; and &apos;però&apos; as distinct alphabemes, while the alphabeme sequences in &apos;lacu&apos; (ablative) and &apos;lacū&apos; (abbreviation for accusative &apos;lacum&apos;) do differ because of the macron (abbreviation mark).

The main distinction between a POGO_Diacritic and a POGO_Textual Grapheme is that a POGO_Diacritic is considered as part of one word, referring to the whole word or to individual graphemes within it, while a POGO_Textual Grapheme like a comma does not refer to one word, but has function to a number of words, and in principle has function to the whole text.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Examples include comma, full stop, question mark, quotes. Especially in pre-modern writing systems, the status of some textual graphemes (such as asterisks or the obelos in ancient Greek papyri) is controversial: some would call them punctuation, some not. So the distinction between current classes &quot;Punctuation Mark&quot; and &quot;Metamark&quot; is blurred in practice. In other words, punctuation has been standardized for Western writing systems only in the contemporary age, and its status in other writing systems is still problematic.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">This class of graphemes correspond to the second articulation of language: vd. G. Sampson, Writing Systems, pp. 39-40. It is important to hightlight that one segmental grapheme does not necessarily represent one phoneme. Writing systems are independent semiotic systems, constituting a &apos;manifestation&apos; of the abstract structures of the language (Hjelmslev, Prolegomena to a Theory of Language, chapter 21, &apos;Language and non-language&apos;) distinct from the &apos;manifestation&apos; of those structures represented by spoken language. Their relationship between intraverbal graphemes and phonemes is complex: examples  of this complexity include abbreviation marks and brevigraphs, but also an alphabetic grapheme such as &apos;h&apos;, to which no phoneme corresponds in the pronunciation in some languages (like Italian); and another alphabetic grapheme such as &apos;c&apos;, to which many pronunciations corresponded in Latin throughout social classes, time and space.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A Grapheme meaning an idea, not a word. The name and the concept are taken from G. Sampson, Writing Systems, pp. 28-38. This covers the concept sometimes called ideogram or pictogram. Examples include numbers and Chinese characters.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>Examples include &apos;white&apos; space between graphical words and other uses of space to arrange marks on the page, such as line breaks. In a written document produced with ink &quot;Space&quot; is not produced directly by adding ink, but instead by arranging other marks in a specific way, so one could argue that &quot;Space&quot; is not a subclass of &quot;Mark&quot;, but I would still argue that it is a subclass of &quot;Grapheme&quot; because it has distinctive value. Its status is therefore quite unique and problematic.</rdfs:comment>

Example of property {+alphabetic}: in &apos;mīa&apos; (abbreviated form for &apos;misericordia&apos;), the four grahemes &apos;m&apos;, &apos;i&apos;, &apos;a&apos; and macron (which can span over the whole graphical word or over a part of it), combined, have function to the alphabemes &apos;m&apos;, &apos;i&apos;, &apos;s&apos;, &apos;e&apos; etc.</rdfs:comment>

Property +{has_a_1_to_1_standard_alphabetic_meaning}, i.e. there is one Alphabeme (not Phoneme) wich it represents its standard alphabetic meaning.

Problematic aspect: some Alphabetic Graphemes (that I would call &apos;Combining Alphabetic Graphemes&apos;) can be put above or below another Alphabetic Grapheme, or &apos;Base Alphabetic Grapheme&apos; (e.g. a small &apos;o&apos; over an &apos;u&apos; or, in Greek, a small iota under an omega), thus being used as abbreviations. The same happens today in superscript such as 1st or 2nd in English, or 1° in Italian (for &apos;primo&apos;).

Properties:

{+linguistic}
{+intraverbal}
{+alphabetic}

Base Alphabetic Graphemes also have properties:
{-combining}

Combining Alphabetic Graphemes also have properties:

        <rdfs:comment>A grapheme that is part of a word (or morpheme). These graphemes correspond to the second articulation of language. Though they normally belong to &apos;phonographic&apos; writing systems (G. Sampson, Writing Systems, pp. 39-45 distinguishes three kinds of phonographic systems: syllabic, segmental and featural), I want to hightlight that one intraverbal grapheme does not necessarily represent one phoneme. Writing systems are independent semiotic systems, constituting a &apos;manifestation&apos; of the abstract structures of the language (Hjelmslev, Prolegomena to a Theory of Language, chapter 21, &apos;Language and non-language&apos;) distinct from the &apos;manifestation&apos; of those structures represented by spoken language. There relationship between intraverbal graphemes and phonemes is complex: examples  of this complexity include diacritics, abbreviation marks and brevigraphs, but also an alphabetic grapheme such as &apos;h&apos;, to which no phoneme corresponds in the pronunciation in some languages (like Italian); and another alphabetic grapheme such as &apos;c&apos;, to which many pronunciations corresponded in Latin throughout social classes, time and space.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A Grapheme meaning a whole word or a morpheme. The name and the concept are taken from G. Sampson, Writing Systems, pp. 38-39. It is worth quoting from page 39: &quot;[...] one might imagine a logographic script for English in which, say, the words walk, walked, walking were represented by three distinct and unrelted graphs, rather than being split into their constituent morphemes [...]. In reality, though, I know of no logographic systems based on units larger than single morphemes&quot;. Bear in mind that word roots (e.g. &quot;dog&quot;) also are &quot;morphemes&quot;.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="https://graphematics.vedph.it/graphematics#Textual_Grapheme"/>
        <rdfs:comment>This class includes textual graphemes that do not qualify as space or punctuation, such as an asterisk pointing to a footnote, a mark in a manuscript pointing to an interlinear or a marginal addition. This class might be eliminated in future versions of the ontology, since it mostly represents &apos;other textual graphemes&apos; (not being space or proper punctuation). However, such metamarks have specific markup conventions in TEI.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="https://graphematics.vedph.it/graphematics#Textual_Grapheme"/>
        <rdfs:comment>Examples include comma, full stop, question mark, quotes. Especially in pre-modern writing systems, the status of some textual graphemes (such as asterisks or the obelos in ancient Greek papyri) is controversial: some would call them punctuation, some not. So the distinction between current classes &quot;Punctuation Mark&quot; and &quot;Metamark&quot; is blurred in practice. In other words, punctuation has been standardized for Western writing systems only in the contemporary age, and its status in other writing systems is still problematic.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:comment>A Grapheme meaning an idea, not a word. The name and the concept are taken from G. Sampson, Writing Systems, pp. 28-38. This covers the concept sometimes called ideogram or pictogram. Examples include numbers and Chinese characters.</rdfs:comment>

        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="https://graphematics.vedph.it/graphematics#Textual_Grapheme"/>
        <rdfs:comment>Examples include &apos;white&apos; space between graphical words and other uses of space to arrange marks on the page, such as line breaks. In a written document produced with ink &quot;Space&quot; is not produced directly by adding ink, but instead by arranging other marks in a specific way, so one could argue that &quot;Space&quot; is not a subclass of &quot;Mark&quot;, but I would still argue that it is a subclass of &quot;Grapheme&quot; because it has distinctive value. Its status is therefore quite unique and problematic.</rdfs:comment>

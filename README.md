# POGO (Philology-Oriented Graphematics Ontology)

An ontology including key concepts of graphematics (such as Grapheme, Allograph, Glyph, Brevigraph etc.). It is oriented towards digital philology: it includes the concepts/objects that a philologist needs to create a digital diplomatic transcription of a textual document (such as European and Near Eastern medieval manuscripts, inscriptions, papyri) written with pre-modern handwritten writing systems.

This ontology is **work in progress**, by [Paolo Monella](http://www.paolomonella.it/).

1. Version 1 (`graphematics_v1.owl`) has been developed in 2019/20 at the [VeDPH](https://unive.it/vedph), Venice Centre for Digital and Publich Humanities, at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice, Italy.

2. Version 2 (`graphematics_v2.owl`) was developed in Fall 2025 as an independent research project.

Version 1 of the ontology was anchored to concepts

- [TX8 Grapheme](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/extensions/crmtex/TX8_Grapheme)
- [TX9 Glyph](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/extensions/crmtex/TX9_Glyph)

of the [CRMtex](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crmtex/sites/default/files/CRMtex_v1.0_March_2020.pdf) ontology version 1.0, of which it constitutes an expansion.

Version 2 is anchored to the same concepts, but is much more closely related to 

- Peter Stokes, [The Archetype Ontology](https://github.com/pastokes/archetype-ontology)

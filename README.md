# Graphematics

Ontology for concepts pertaining graphemes and writing systems.

This is _work in progress_: it is being actively developed as of summer 2020.

Two closely related ontologies, to which my own ontology will eventually be intertwined, are
- Peter Stokes, [The Archetype Ontology](https://github.com/pastokes/archetype-ontology)
- Frekerike Neuber, [typoo](https://github.com/FrederikeNeuber/typoo/)

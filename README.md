# POGO (Philology-Oriented Graphematics Ontology)


An ontology including key concepts of graphematics (such as Grapheme, Allograph, Glyph). It is oriented towards digital philology, and particularly towards the diplomatic transcription of textual documents (such as European and Middle Eastern medieval manuscripts, inscriptions, papyri) written with pre-modern handwritten writing systems.

This ontology is **work in progress**: it is being actively developed as of summer 2020 by [Paolo Monella](http://www1.unipa.it/paolo.monella/) at the [VeDPH](https://unive.it/vedph), Venice Centre for Digital and Publich Humanities, at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice, Italy.

The ontology is anchored to concepts

- [TX8 Grapheme](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crmtex/TX8_Grapheme)
- [TX9 Glyph](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crmtex/TX9_Glyph)

of the [CRMtex](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crmtex/sites/default/files/CRMtex_v1.0_March_2020.pdf) ontology version 1.0, of which it constitutes an expansion.

Two closely related ontologies, to which this ontology is also connected (mostly by means of `owl:equivalentClass`) are:
- Peter Stokes, [The Archetype Ontology](https://github.com/pastokes/archetype-ontology)
- Frekerike Neuber, [typoo](https://github.com/FrederikeNeuber/typoo/)

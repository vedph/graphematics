# VeDPH Graphematics

VeDPH (Venice Centre for Digital and Publich Humanities) Graphematics ontology oriented towards philology based on documents created with pre-modern handwritten writing systems.

This is **work in progress**: it is being actively developed as of summer 2020.

The ontology is anchored to concepts

- [TX8 Grapheme](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crmtex/TX8_Grapheme)
- [TX9 Glyph](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crmtex/TX9_Glyph)

of the [CRMtex](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crmtex/sites/default/files/CRMtex_v1.0_March_2020.pdf) ontology version 1.0, of which it constitutes and expansion.


Two closely related ontologies, to which this ontology is connected (mostly by means of `owl:equivalentClass`) are:
- Peter Stokes, [The Archetype Ontology](https://github.com/pastokes/archetype-ontology)
- Frekerike Neuber, [typoo](https://github.com/FrederikeNeuber/typoo/)

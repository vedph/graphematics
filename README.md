# POGO (Philology-Oriented Graphematics Ontology)


An ontology including key concepts of graphematics (such as Grapheme, Allograph, Glyph, Brevigraph etc.). It is oriented towards digital philology: it includes the concepts/objects that a philologist needs to create a digital diplomatic transcription of a textual document (such as European and Near Eastern medieval manuscripts, inscriptions, papyri) written with pre-modern handwritten writing systems.

This ontology is **work in progress**: it is being actively developed as of summer 2020 by [Paolo Monella](http://www1.unipa.it/paolo.monella/) at the [VeDPH](https://unive.it/vedph), Venice Centre for Digital and Publich Humanities, at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice, Italy.

The ontology is anchored to concepts

- [TX8 Grapheme](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/extensions/crmtex/TX8_Grapheme)
- [TX9 Glyph](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/extensions/crmtex/TX9_Glyph)

of the [CRMtex](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crmtex/sites/default/files/CRMtex_v1.0_March_2020.pdf) ontology version 1.0, of which it constitutes an expansion.

Two closely related ontologies, to which this ontology is also connected (mostly by means of `owl:equivalentClass`) are:
- Peter Stokes, [The Archetype Ontology](https://github.com/pastokes/archetype-ontology)
- Frekerike Neuber, [typoo](https://github.com/FrederikeNeuber/typoo/)

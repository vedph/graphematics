# VeDPH Graphematics

Ontology for concepts pertaining to graphemes and writing systems, oriented to philology.

This is _work in progress_: it is being actively developed as of summer 2020.

Three closely related ontologies, to which this ontology will eventually be intertwined, are
- Peter Stokes, [The Archetype Ontology](https://github.com/pastokes/archetype-ontology)
- [CRMtex](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crmtex/sites/default/files/CRMtex_v1.0_March_2020.pdf)
- Frekerike Neuber, [typoo](https://github.com/FrederikeNeuber/typoo/)
